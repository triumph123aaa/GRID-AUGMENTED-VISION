# GRID-AUGMENTED-VISION
## Introduction
Grid-Augmented Vision is a simple yet powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding in multi-modal AI systems. The project introduces a straightforward method of overlaying a 9Ã—9 black grid pattern onto input images, which significantly improves the ability of AI models to precisely locate and map objects within images without requiring complex vision backbone architectures.
### Why Grid-Augmented Vision?
Traditional computer vision systems often struggle with precise spatial localization, particularly when converting conceptual object recognition into accurate coordinate mapping. While these systems excel at identifying objects, they frequently face challenges in determining exact locations. Our grid-based approach addresses this limitation by providing explicit spatial reference points that help models better understand and map spatial relationships.
